## main.js
This file is like the `int main();` of programs, setting up the whole GNOME Shell interface and making parts available to everyone else (`Top Panel/Overview/Message Tray/...`). Many global objects in GNOME Shell create just one instance. These are stored here.
This file also handles dynamic workspaces (when you have no windows left on a workspace it is removed).

- Some of the objects stored to be accessed by others (there are more, see `main.js`):
    - panel: this is the top panel. If you want to add buttons to the status area etc, you use this panel to add them to.
    - hotCorners: the hot corner(s), e.g. the top-left one (move your cursor over it and the Overview opens).
    - overview: the Overview.
    - runDialog: the dialog when you press Alt+F2.
    - lookingGlass: the looking glass.
    - messageTray: the message tray.
    - shellDBusService: GNOME-Shell's Dbus service.
    - magnifier: the accessibility magnifier.
    - keyboard: the accessibility on-screen keyboard.
- Some handy functions (there are other functions in main.js too; these are just some handy one):
    - `getThemeStylesheet()`: gets the file path for the (custom) theme you are using for GNOME Shell, if any (e.g. `$HOME/.themes/<themename>/gnome-shell/gnome-shell.css`). If you are not using a custom gnome-shell theme, this will be null.
    - `setThemeStylesheet(path)`: sets the file path for the custom theme for GNOME Shell (but doesn't actually cause a theme change; use `loadTheme` to reload the theme after doing this).
    - `loadTheme()`: reloads the style for GNOME Shell. It sets the `getThemeStylesheet` (any custom GNOME Shell theme if you have one, or just the default `/usr/share/gnome-shell/themes/gnome-shell.css`) as the top priority style sheet, and then loads all the extra stylesheets (e.g. extension stylesheets) at a lower priority. This is why if you set a style in your extension's `stylesheet.css` that conflicts with the a GNOME Shell style class, GNOME Shell will win.
    - `notify(msg, details)`: creates a GNOME Shell notification (i.e. popup from the message tray) with title `msg` and text `details`.
    - `notifyError(msg, details)`: calls `notify(msg, details)` to send a popup notification from the message tray
    - `pushModal(actor, timestamp, options)`: Grabs all keyboard/mouse input to the stage and focuses actor. When the modal stack is empty we return focus to whatever had focus before `pushModal` was called. The `Overview`, `Run Dialog`, `Looking Glass`, and `Modal Dialogs` all use this (there are probably more too).
    - `popModal(actor, timestamp)`: Opposite of `pushModal` (removes actor from the modal stack).
    - `initializeDeferredWork(actor, callback, props)`: Sets up a callback to be invoked either when actor is mapped, or when the machine is idle - useful if your actor isn't always visible on the screen and you don't want to consume resources updating if the actor isn't actually visible. (The `Overview` actors are all examples of these). Returns a work ID that you can use with `queueDeferredWork` every time you update the actor.
    - `queueDeferredWork(workId)`: Ensures that the work identified by `workId` will be run on map or timeout. It is called by default on `initializeDeferredWork`, call it again when (say) the data being displayed by the actor changes.


- RestartMessage: 

## messageList.js

- NotificationPolicy: 
- NotificationGenericPolicy: 
- NotificationApplicationPolicy: 
- Notification: Base class defining a notification - the UI element. A notification belongs to a `Source` and has a title and text. In banner mode, the notification shows an icont, title, and banner on a single line. If the notification has additional elements in it or the banner doesn't fit on a single line, the notification is expandable. See `messageTray.js` for much more in-depth documentation.
- NotificationBanner:

- SourceActorWithLabel: 
- Source: Abstract class defining a notifications source. It provides the UI element of the icon + notification counter in the message tray
- MessageTray: The `MessageTray` class
- SystemNotificationSource: Define a system source. It is inherit from `Source`. 

If you wish to create notifications, the `MessageTray.Source` is the class you subclass. You need to implement the `createNotificationIcon` function at a minimum. When you want to send a notification from that source, use `source.notify(notification)`, where `notification` is a `MessageTray.Notification` or subclass thereof

## modalDialog.js
- ModalDialog: A handy class defining a modal dialog. Use `.setButtons` to add buttons to it, and `open/close` to show or hide it.

> The panel. Yellow: _leftBox, Green: _centerBox, Red: _rightBox

![panel.js](./media/panel-2.png)
> AppMenuButton with its dropdown menu

![panel.js](./media/panel-3.png)
> AggregateMenu

- AppMenuButton: This is the top titlebar (stored in `Main.panel._appMenu`). Inherits from [panelMenu.Button](#panelmenujs), so it has a dropdown menu (by default showing `Quit`)
- ActivitiesButton: The `Activities` button on the Top Left that triggers the overview. It is a [panelMenu.Button](#panelmenujs) but without a menu. Contains the [layout.HotCorner](layoutjs) that triggers the overview
- PanelCorner: The black rounded corners that extend down from the `Top Panel` on either side of the screen. They are painted onto the screen using the panel colour
- AggregateLayout: 
- AggregateMenu: It is the `Status Area` button, it holds the `network/location/power/brightness/volume/system/etc` indicators
- Panel: The `Top Panel`, stored in `Main.panel`. It is split into three `boxes` into which various panel elements are all placed:
    - _leftBox, `Main.panel._leftBox`: Contains the `ActivitiesButton` and the `AppMenuButton`
    - _centerBox, `Main.panel._centerBox`: Contains the [dateMenu.DateMenuButton](#datemenujs) button
    - _rightBox, `Main.panel._rightBox`: Contains the `AggregateMenu`/`Status Area`. However when you want to insert icons into the `Status Area` you should use `Main.panel.addToStatusArea(role, myButton, position)` where `role` is the role that button performs (`network`, `a11y`, ...). There can only be one button performing each role in the `Status Area`


## panelMenu.js
![panelMenu.js](./media/panelmenu.png)
> Example of a panelMenu.Button, being the indicator and menu where the indicator is an icon

- ButtonBox: The base `Button` class for buttons in the `Panel`
- Button: Inherits from [panelMenu.ButtonBox](#panelmenujs) - adds a menu. So this is an object for use in the `Panel` that will have a menu and some sort of display item (e.g. an icon), which you are responsible for defining and adding. The [dateMenu.DateMenuButton](#datemenujs) is an example of this
- SystemIndicator: This is just a `Button` with an icon. Feed it in an icon name (one of the stock icon names) and it will display it. Just about every icon you have in your `Status Area` is one of these

## pointerWatcher.js
- PointerWatch: 
- PointerWatcher: 

## popupMenu.js
![popupMenu.js](./media/popupmenu-1.png)
![popupMenu.js](./media/popupmenu-2.png)
- PopupBaseMenuItem: Base class for popup menu items - and empty popup menu item. Has an `activate` signal that gets fired when the item is activated. Use `.addActor` to add visual elements to it like a `St.Label`. All the other `Popup*MenuItem` classes inherit from this.
- PopupMenuItem: A `PopupBaseMenuItem` that displays text in a `St.Label`.
- PopupSeparatorMenuItem: A `PopupBaseMenuItem` that is a separator.
- Switch: An on-off toggle switch
- PopupSwitchMenuItem: A `PopupBaseMenuItem` containing a label/text and a `Switch` to the right. Use the `toggled` signal to determine when the user toggles it.
- PopupImageMenuItem: A `PopupBaseMenuItem` containing a label/text and an icon to the right.
- PopupMenuBase: The base class for a popup menu (The menu that appears when you click most of the items in the status area). You don't use this directly (unless you are extending it); use any of its child classes and use `menu.addMenuItem` to add a popup menu item/submenu to it.
- PopupMenu: Extends `PopupMenuBase` to provide a popup menu. This is the main popup menu class. (The one that gets used for all the [panelMenu.Button](#panelmenujs)s)
- PopupDummyMenu: 
- PopupSubMenu: A popup submenu - designed to be nested within a `PopupMenu`, has a scrollbar in case the content is too long. If you want to add it to a `PopupMenu` as a collapsible menu section, use `PopupSubMenuMenuItem`
- PopupMenuSection: This acts like a `PopupSubMenu`, but to the user just looks like a normal `PopupMenu`. It can be useful to add multiple `PopupMenuSection`s to a single `PopupMenu` to *group* items together code-wise (and to the user it looks like a flat popup menu).
- PopupSubMenuMenuItem: A `PopupBaseMenuItem` defining a collapsible submenu - click on it to expand/open the submenu and reveal the items inside. It is really just a `PopupBaseMenuItem` with label and a `PopupSubMenu`. Use `myItem.menu.addMenuItem` to add to its menu.
- PopupMenuManager:  Extracted from source `Basic implementation of a menu manager. Call addMenu to add menus`

## scripting.js
**Documentation extracted from the source**
This module provides functionality for driving the shell user interface in an automated fashion. The primary current use case for this is automated performance testing (see `runPerfScript()`), but it could be applied to other forms of automation, such as testing for correctness as well.

When scripting an automated test we want to make a series of calls in a linear fashion, but we also want to be able to let the main loop run so actions can finish. For this reason we write the script as a generator function that yields when it want to let the main loop run.

```javascript
yield Scripting.sleep(1000);
main.overview.show();
yield Scripting.waitLeisure();
```
While it isn't important to the person writing the script, the actual yielded result is a function that the caller uses to provide the callback for resuming the script.

Provides:
- `sleep(milliseconds)`: Used within an automation script to pause the the execution of the current script for the specified amount of time. Use as:
```javascript
    yield Scripting.sleep(500);
```
- `waitLeisure()`: Used within an automation script to pause the the execution of the current script until the shell is completely idle. Use as:
```javascript
    yield Scripting.waitLeisure();
```
- PerfHelper: DBus proxy for `org.gnome.shell.PerfHelper`
- `createTestWindow(width, height, alpha, maximized)`: Creates a window using `gnome-shell-perf-helper` for testing purposes. While this function can be used with yield in an automation script to pause until the DBus call to the helper process returns, because of the normal X asynchronous mapping process, to actually wait until the window has been mapped and exposed, use `waitTestWindows()`
- `waitTestWindows()`: Used within an automation script to pause until all windows previously created with `createTestWindow` have been mapped and exposed.
- `destroyTestWindows()`: Destroys all windows previously created with `createTestWindow()`. While this function can be used with yield in an automation script to pause until the D-Bus call to the helper process returns, this doesn't guarantee that Mutter has actually finished the destroy process because of normal X asynchronicity.
- `defineScriptEvent(name, description)`: Convenience function to define a zero-argument performance event within the `script` namespace that is reserved for events defined locally within a performance automation script.
- `scriptEvent(name)`: Convenience function to record a script-local performance event previously defined with `defineScriptEvent`
- `collectStatistics()`: Convenience function to trigger statistics collection.
- `runPerfScript(scriptModule)`: module object with run and finish functions and event handlers. Runs a script for automated collection of performance data. The script is defined as a Javascript module with specified contents. See the `scripting.js` file for much more detail (it's documented in there).

When the object being dragged leaves the `gnome-shell-object`, the `drage-end` signal is fired. The class somehow incorporates with [dnd.js](#dndjs) code too whereby a draggable target/object registered with `dnd.js` has the appropiate events called on it. Use `Main.xdndHandler` to access the instance of the handler and connect to its signals.
